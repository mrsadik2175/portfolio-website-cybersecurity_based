# Mr. Sadik — Portfolio

This repository is a clean, responsive portfolio website for **Md Soyab Akhter Sadik** (Mr. Sadik). It is built as a static site (HTML/CSS/JS) and is ready for GitHub Pages.

## Files
- `index.html` — Main page
- `styles.css` — Styles (CSS variables for easy theme/customization)
- `script.js` — Tiny JS for theme, menu, and contact demo
- `mr_sadik_logo.png` — Logo image (place in repo root)
- `mr_sadik_dp.png` — Profile picture (place in repo root)
- `mr_sadik_cv.pdf` — CV (place in repo root)
- `README.md` — You are reading it

## Project Highlights
This portfolio is more than a simple static page — it’s built to reflect my work and mindset.

- Clean and modern design focused on clarity and performance  
- Responsive layout that adapts to all screens  
- Easily customizable structure with reusable components  
- Fast and secure — no frameworks, no dependencies  
- Perfect starting point for personal branding or professional showcase

## Customize
- Edit text and replace placeholder links in `index.html`.
- Change colors by editing `:root` variables in `styles.css` (accent colors are kept).
- Replace project cards with your real projects (each `.project-card`).
- Hook the contact form to Formspree/Netlify or your backend to enable messages.

## Notes
- The design uses CSS variables so you can quickly adjust spacing, radii, and accent colors.
- Light / dark mode preference is saved in `localStorage`.
